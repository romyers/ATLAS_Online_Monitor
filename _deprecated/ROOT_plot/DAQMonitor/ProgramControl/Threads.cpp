// NOTE: This logic is a little complex because we need the threads vector
//       to 'refresh' every time we join. We also need to make sure 
//       the threads vector isn't modified while we're validating and
//       retrieving a thread from it, but we can't join while the
//       threadLock is locked, or the program will deadlock.
//       
//       This implementation acts as an iteration step, checking the
//       threads vector for threads to join, grabbing a thread off the
//       vector, and joining it. If there are no threads to join, it
//       returns false.
//
//       Used as a condition in a while loop, this will join all threads
//       in the thread vector, even if the thread was added to the vector
//       after the first join call.
